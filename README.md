Success Prediction of Kickstarter listed projects: 


Kickstarter is a global crowdfunding platform built around creative projects/ideas. It serves as a launchpad for creators to realize their project ideas.  The aim is to develop a model that could help backers select the right project/idea by predicting which projects are likely to be successful


Project Flow
1. Defining problem statement
2. Data cleaning

6. Results and Observations


Data:

a) The data is collected from the Kickstarter platform for 380,000 projects spanning over 9 years – from 2009 to 2018. The dataset includes project categories, funding deadlines, pledged amounts, countries, and number of backers.

b) Apart from success and failure, the other project states can be classified as follows:
Cancelled – User cancels the project
Suspended – Project deemed to be in violation of Kickstarter’s rules
Undefined – No data available for the project state
Live – Current projects; ignored due to incomplete data

Henceforth, we are considering only successful and failed projects, which comprise 88% of the overall dataset
